### Add personal account

Some people can actually add a personal account to websites like Gmail or YouTube even when their Chrome policies prevent adding personal accounts to the actual computer or browser.

1. First, you'll have to break the connection between your Chromebook and Chrome. 
2. This can be done by going to https://myaccount.google.com/device-activity with your school account on another device, then finding your Chromebook on that page and clicking the sign out button, or by going to `chrome://settings/signOut` (if you can, do them both as it will increase your chances of this working)
3. Finally, go to [this link](https://tinyurl.com/addsession) to add an account (you can even do this multiple times) 

**Note that this will not work for everybody (you may get a "this account is not allowed to sign in within your network" error) and you'll have to repeat the steps every time you sign out and back into your computer.**
