1. Find a page belonging to the extension you want to disable. In this case GoGuardian this isgoing to be bookmark A.
```
chrome-extension://haldlgldplgnggkjaafhelgiaglafanh/manifest.json
```

2. Bookmark the extension page (bookmark A) if you wish. Then, bookmark `chrome://kill` (B) and `chrome://hang` (C). 
3. While on the extension page (A), click the `chrome://kill` bookmark (B). The page should crash. You should already have the next step prepared. 
4. Instantly start spamming `chrome://hang` (bookmark C) and quickly reload the page while spamming (ideally with the refresh key on your keyboard or `ctrl`+`R`). You should have reloaded within one or two seconds of killing the page. 

If the extension page (bookmark A) no longer loads, then it worked! You can close your tabs and the extension will basically be dead. If nothing loads, then you probably reloaded too late or spammed too slow. This isn't rocket science! Restart your computer to revert back to normal.
